## 🎨 Design

I wanted my site to be colorful and modern but couldn't quite make up my mind on what color to use. I also wanted to highlight the various important aspects of my life: my love for coding, my cat, basketball, food, The Simpsons, etc...so rather than choosing one, I decided on an "All of the above" approach through a color/theme switcher and include them all!

I used the principles and color palette of Google's Material Design for a simple, modern look.

My website is designed to be responsive and work on all devices, from desktops to smartphones. You can easily access my site on any device and get the full experience.
